##  About

ManageHub is structured to handle everyday operational needs of tech hubs, from managing members to tracking workspace usage and attendance using biometric authentication. The platform is modular, scalable, and designed with real-world enterprise needs in mind.

##  Key Features

*  **Biometric Authentication** — Supports biometric clock-ins/outs for users and staff.
* **User & Role Management** — Manage accounts, roles, and permissions.
*  **Workspace Tracking** — Monitor usage of workspaces, seats, and resources.
*  **Analytics & Logs** — View attendance and activity logs.
*  **Team Collaboration** — Support for teams with admin roles.
*  **Modular Architecture** — Easy to extend or customize for future needs.

## Tech Stack

ManageHub uses a modern full-stack technology stack:

| Layer                  | Technology                                     |               |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| Frontend               | **Next.js**, React, Tailwind CSS               |               |
| Backend                | **NestJS**, Node.js                            |               |
| Database               | **PostgreSQL**                                 |               |
| Blockchain / Contracts | Rust, Stellar                                  |               |
| Deployment             | Vercel 🚀 (Frontend & possibly Serverless API) |               |

> Side note: Using NestJS for API and backend services alongside Next.js for the frontend is a powerful combination for maintainable, scalable projects, especially when complex business logic or multi-client access is needed — something Next.js alone doesn’t fully optimize for in large systems.

##  Getting Started

These instructions help you run the project locally for development or testing.

###  Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

* Node.js ≥ 18.x
* npm or yarn
* PostgreSQL database
* Rust toolchain (if building or interacting with *contracts*)

---

###  Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DistinctCodes/ManageHub.git
cd ManageHub
```

2. **Install dependencies**

```bash
# frontend
cd frontend
npm install

# backend
cd ../backend
npm install
```

---

### Environment Variables

Copy the example environment variables and configure them:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Update variables such as:

* `DATABASE_URL` — PostgreSQL connection string
* `JWT_SECRET` / other secrets
* Any API keys for external services

---

##  Usage

**Run backend:**

npm run start:dev
```

**Run frontend:**

```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.
