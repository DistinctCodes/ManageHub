## 🛠️ Tech Stack

ManageHub uses a modern full-stack technology stack:

| Layer                  | Technology                                     |               |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| Frontend               | **Next.js**, React, Tailwind CSS               |               |
| Backend                | **NestJS**, Node.js                            |               |
| Database               | **PostgreSQL**                                 |               |
| Blockchain / Contracts | Rust, Stellar                                  |               |
| Deployment             | Vercel 🚀 (Frontend & possibly Serverless API) |               |

> Side note: Using NestJS for API and backend services alongside Next.js for the frontend is a powerful combination for maintainable, scalable projects, especially when complex business logic or multi-client access is needed — something Next.js alone doesn’t fully optimize for in large systems.
